- Implement a BVH for mesh rendering

// Target Scene i would like to have on my portfolio

- Simple classic cornel box
- Monkey with simple background

// Key fetures for portfolio?
- Multithreading task system
- Depth of field
- Motion blur
- Model loading
- BVH using the median split method
- Custum profile loggin?

// Things to try with BVH
- Try previous bvh model in part2
- Redo hit after figuring out the prims check was incorrect

// @note(Darren): Use unint32_t and the like more through out code?
